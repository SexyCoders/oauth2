# oauth2

This was a work in progress for the best part of 2 years.

Unfortunately since our needs forced us to take a different path, we have to drop this solution because its too much for our team to maintain at the moment.

<b>This repository is therefore no longer maintained since we have migrated to a keycloak solution!</b>

It was a very happy journey with lots of code generated for future projects, like the c++/js crypto library (under the libauth.js repository).

We thank all contributors and wish them well!

Final goodbye,

==============================================================

OAuth2 implementation using PHP-Slim Mariadb and Redis.

Just fork and edit the index.php file changing the urls and parameters.

We run this implementation using docker but it should be easilly portable to any other system!

Happy Coding,
